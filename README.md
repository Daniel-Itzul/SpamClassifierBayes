# Spam Classifier Naive Bayes
# Description
* This was a practice excercise in Frank's Kane course on Machine Learning in Python.
* I added the capability to work with a test/train split and a function to assess accuracy by identifying
** True positives
** False positives
** True negatives
** False negatives
* The spam classifier using Naive Bayes with the current dataset gets some false negatives but not false positives.
